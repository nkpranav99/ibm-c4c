# Material Associations System

## Overview

The chatbot now includes an intelligent material association system that helps users understand which waste materials can be combined together for various business applications.

## How It Works

When a user expresses a business idea, the chatbot:

1. **Identifies the business type** (e.g., plastic recycling, construction, biofuel)
2. **Finds compatible materials** from our marketplace
3. **Suggests material combinations** that work well together
4. **Provides optimal ratios** for mixing materials
5. **Calculates total costs** for purchasing the materials
6. **Explains use cases** for each combination

## Material Combinations

### 1. Composite Construction Materials
**Materials:** Fly Ash, Bottom Ash, Concrete Rubble, Brick Waste
- **Use:** Create eco-friendly construction blocks
- **Ratio:** 60% Ash + 25% Concrete + 15% Brick Waste

**Chatbot:** 
```
ðŸŽ¯ Perfect! I can help you start your business!

## ðŸ’¼ Textile Manufacturing

**How to use these materials:**
Recycle into new fabrics, insulation material, or stuffing

### ðŸ”— Material Combination Suggestion

**Compatible Materials:**
â€¢ Cotton Scrap
â€¢ Fabric Remnants
â€¢ PET Bottles

**Best Use:** Create recycled fiber composites for automotive and furniture

**Optimal Ratio:** 50% Cotton + 30% Fabric + 20% PET fibers

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: Using these materials together will create more valuable composite products!

**ðŸ“¦ Available raw materials:**
1. Cotton Scrap - 130 kg @ â‚¹1.04/kg = â‚¹135.20
2. Fabric Remnants - 385 kg @ â‚¹0.80/kg = â‚¹308.00

### ðŸ’° TOTAL ESTIMATED COST: â‚¹443.20

**ðŸš€ Next Steps:**
1. Review materials and costs
2. Contact sellers
3. Negotiate bulk pricing
4. Plan manufacturing process
