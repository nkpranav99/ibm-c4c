# Auctions Router Fix

## Issue
The `/api/auctions/10` endpoint was returning 404 errors because:
1. The auctions router was disabled due to SQLAlchemy dependencies
2. The `data/auctions.json` file didn't exist

## Solution

### 1. Converted Auctions Router to JSON Storage
- Removed all SQLAlchemy imports from `app/routers/auctions.py`
- Updated to use `app/utils/mock_storage.py` functions
- Implemented JSON-based auction and bid management

### 2. Created Missing Data Files
```bash
echo '[]' > data/auctions.json
echo '[]' > data/bids.json
echo '[]' > data/orders.json
```

### 3. Updated Setup Script
Modified `setup_json_data.py` to automatically create empty data files for auctions, bids, and orders.

## Current Status

✅ **Auctions router is now active and working**
- `/api/auctions/{listing_id}` - Get auction for a listing (returns 404 if no auction exists)
- `/api/auctions/{auction_id}/bid` - Place a bid
- `/api/auctions/{auction_id}/bids` - Get all bids for an auction
- `/api/auctions/active` - Get active auctions

✅ **JSON files created** - auctions.json, bids.json, orders.json all exist

✅ **Server responds correctly** - 404 is the expected response when no auction exists for a listing

## Testing

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check auction endpoint (will return 404 if no auction exists - this is correct!)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/auctions/10

# Expected response:
# {"detail": "Auction not found"}
```

## Next Steps

To actually create an auction, you would need to:
1. Call the create auction endpoint (not yet implemented for JSON storage)
2. Or manually add auction data to `data/auctions.json`

Example auction data structure:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "listing_id": 10,
  "starting_bid": 100.0,
  "current_highest_bid": 100.0,
  "end_time": "2025-11-30T00:00:00",
  "is_active": true,
  "winner_id": null,
  "created_at": "2025-10-30T10:00:00",
  "updated_at": null
}
```

## Summary

The auctions endpoint is now working correctly! The 404 response you're seeing means "no auction exists for listing 10", which is the correct behavior. The router is properly integrated with JSON storage and ready to handle auction operations.
